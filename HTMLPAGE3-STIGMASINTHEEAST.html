  <h1 ALIGN="center" style="color: black; font-size: 40px;"><B><U>Mental Health Stigmas in the East</U></B></h1>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">In the East, primarily in Asia however, the perception of mental health and the stigma that comes from this is significantly, if not entirely, different than that of the Western countries, like the U.S, U.K, or other European countries. Here, studies, good employment, family reputation, and status, as well as the prospect of immigration to the U.S. stand as high priorities in the minds of these people, considering the fact that most immigrants to the U.S. come from this continent.</p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">According to a special issue produced by the National Institute Mental Health, age at immigration appears to affect the onset of mental disorders in Asian Americans. <B>Based on data from more than 2,095 Asian Americans collected for the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), David Takeuchi, PhD, University of Washington, and colleagues found that those who immigrated during childhood, as well as U.S. born Asians, were much more likely to have a mental disorder in their lifetimes than other immigrant generations. Asian immigrants who arrived at age 12 or younger had a greater risk for psychiatric disorders during childhood than their U.S. born counterparts; this risk, along with risk for substance abuse, increased during adolescence. Asian immigrants who arrived before age 41 also had a greater risk of onset for mood disorders during or shortly after immigration, whereas those who arrived after age 41 were more likely to have experienced onset before immigration.</B></p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Here, we can see that due to other prospects, dreams, and experiences Asians and other Easterners have in comparison to those of the Western Hemisphere, making them more prone to mental illnesses than others, due to experiences they had to handle and deal with alone, which in the lives of their U.S. or Western counterparts, we see no such experiences.
But, <B><U>How do Eastern cultures view mental health?</U></B></p>

    <img src="shetal.jpg" width="50%" height="30%">
</div>


<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Shetal is a young British, South Asian woman who lives in the U.K. She had suffered with anxiety for a long time. When interviewed by Mind UK, an organization dedicated to mental health promotion and help, she had said, "I cannot pinpoint the first time I felt anxious, but I do know when things started to become difficult and unmanageable. During my mid-twenties, my anxiety was at its peak. I constantly felt claustrophobic, even in open spaces, my thoughts ran a 1,000 miles per minute, I was out of breath but all I was doing was watching TV. I felt like the world was caving in on me and I had no escape. At this point I was not sure what I was feeling, and I could not even bring myself to tell anyone, mostly because of my own insecurities. How do you explain to someone that this is how you are feeling?"</p>

<p ALIGN="center" style="color: darkblue; font-size: 30px;">"I love my culture and my roots, but talking about feelings and emotions was not ‘normal’ practice."</p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Shetal as no exception to the priorities of those from Eastern cultures. She had said, "I am a British South Asian woman, which has pressures of its own. Don’t get me wrong, I love my culture and my roots but talking about feelings and emotions was not ‘normal’ practice. There is also the battle that many South Asian women like me, are still fighting for their rights in the community. The rights to be shown equality, the right that a woman’s place is not in just the home, getting married and bearing children. Even though times have changed in many ways, this kind of thinking is still be around."</p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Just like Shetal, many more people suffer like this, not knowing what to do or how to do it. This significantly contributes to the stigma that others, as well as the ones with mental health issues, face. By not knowing what to do or what resources are available to them, people think that mental health is something that only is happening to them. They will start to think that something is wrong with them, that they are different, almost alien to others around them. This could further compromise their states, and result in devastating circumstances.</p>
