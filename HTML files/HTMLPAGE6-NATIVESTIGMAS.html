<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">It is not unknown that Native Americans have faced the brunt of American Westward Expansion as well as territorial conquests. Over the course of American history, Native Americans have been forcibly marched, relocated, killed, and stripped of their traditional beliefs and practices. They were forcibly sent to English schools where they were punished for speaking their mother tongue. Native Americans were suppressed to become more like the white American, making them feel bad about their language, dress, and culture.</p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">This unfortunate history is what has caused tensions between Native Americans and U.S. Americans, causing Native Americans to reject "American culture" to use their own ways. These issues can be associated with the perspective that mental health is a punishment of God or even a consequence or effect from American hostility, and when researched, it seems to be the case. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, <B>nearly 20 percent of Native American middle school students in a single reservation attempted suicide, double the rate for the general teenage population,</B> according to a study led by Teresa LaFromboise, PhD, Stanford University, and funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The researchers evaluated 122 students who belonged to the Metis or Ojibwa tribes living in the Northern Plains and found that a sense of connection or belonging to their school community appeared have a strong, protective effect against suicidal thoughts. <B>Overall, the two strongest predictors for thinking about suicide were depression and substance abuse.</B></p>
