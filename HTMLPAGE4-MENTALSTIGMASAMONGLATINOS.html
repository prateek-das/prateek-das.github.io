<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Mental health is an integral part of our overall well-being, yet, for many, seeking support remains challenging. This is especially true for Latino people, who face unique cultural and societal challenges when confronting mental health issues.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">At the heart of the Hispanic/Latino (H/L) cultures is an emphasis on strength, resilience, and self-reliance. These values, although positive in many respects, can inadvertently act as barriers. The concept of machismo, which cherishes traditional masculine traits like dominance, stoicism, and emotional restraint, might suggest that seeking help for mental health is a sign of weakness. However, it is essential to recognize that seeking help is, in fact, a sign of strength and self-awareness.</p>

<p ALIGN="left" style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Similarly to Asians, most of U.S. immigrants are made up of people of the Latino and Hispanic community. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, information on <B>more than 2,554 Latinos interviewed for the NLAAS showed that age at immigration was also key in the mental health of this diverse minority population</B>, found Margarita Alegría, PhD, Harvard University, and colleagues. <B>In general, past age 7, the older the person at immigration, the later the onset of psychiatric disorders.</B> Those who arrived later in life had lower lifetime prevalence rates than younger immigrants or U.S. born Latinos. <B>However, after about age 30, the risk of depressive disorders increased among these later-arriving Latino immigrants, whereas risk tended to decrease between ages 30-40 for U.S. born Latinos and immigrants arriving before age 7.</B> Latinos arriving between ages 0-6 had very high risks of onset shortly after immigration, but after several years, their lifetime prevalence rates approached those of Latinos born in the United States.</p>
